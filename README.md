# Semantic Similarity Checker

The Semantic Similarity Checker is a tool that allows users to compare the semantic similarity between texts in two different files. By leveraging pre-trained models such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, the system extracts text from the provided files and computes a semantic similarity score, indicating how similar the texts are.

## Features

- Text scraping: The system automatically extracts the textual content from the provided files, ensuring that only the relevant text is used for comparison.
- Pre-trained models: Utilizes state-of-the-art pre-trained models, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, which have been trained on vast amounts of data to capture semantic information effectively.
- Semantic similarity scoring: Generates a semantic similarity score between the texts of the two documents, providing an objective measure of their similarity.
- User-friendly interface: The system offers a simple and intuitive command-line interface, allowing users to provide the input files and receive the similarity score with ease.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-similarity-checker.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained models:

## Usage

1. Prepare your input files:
   - Ensure your files are in a compatible format (e.g., .txt, .docx).
   - Select the files using choose files button.

2. Run the Semantic Similarity Checker:
    press upload button to run the Semantic Similarity Checker.

3. View the results:
   - The system will display the semantic similarity score between the texts of the two input files, indicating their degree of similarity.
